# Time Complexity Studies

## Overview
Welcome to the Time Complexity Studies section of the Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This collection of files and resources is a result of a combination of academic studies at the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG) and dedicated self-study efforts. Understanding time complexity is crucial in the field of computer science, helping to analyze the efficiency of algorithms as input sizes grow.

## Academic Background
### University: Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG)
Data Structures and Algorithms are subjects in my third semester at college, and they will guide me through my studies.

## Contents
Examples of the most important time complexities in code that you will definitely encounter while programming, perhaps without even realizing it. After seeing this, I hope it clears your vision on that.

## Theoretical Studies
For a more in-depth understanding of time complexity and related concepts, consider exploring the accompanying [theoretical studies site](https://axelvaz.notion.site/Asymptotic-Analysis-f5212a26b9fb45b5b6f6210ff9c49a29?pvs=4). This resource provides additional explanations, examples, and supplementary materials to enhance your comprehension of the subject matter.

### How to Use
Each file in this repository includes comments to facilitate understanding. Read through the comments alongside the code to grasp the intricacies of the algorithms and their time complexities.

### Contribution
Feel free to contribute by suggesting improvements, reporting issues, or adding new algorithms. Contributions from the community can enrich the learning experience for everyone.
